/*Sphenic number can be checked by fact that every sphenic number will have exactly 8 divisor

So first We will try to find if the number is having exactly 8 divisors if not then simply answer is no.

If there are exactly 8 divisors then we will confirm whether the first 3 digits after 1 are prime or not.

Eg. 30 (sphenic number)

30-p*q*r(i.e p,q and rare three distinÄ…t prime no and their product are 30)
